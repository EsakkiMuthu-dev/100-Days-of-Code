/*
Task:

Create a prototype chain of objects representing different vehicles. The chain should include a base object called Vehicle with a property type set to 'Generic Vehicle' and a method start that returns 'Starting the vehicle'. Create two derived objects, Car and Bicycle, which inherit from the Vehicle prototype. The Car object should have a property model set to 'SUV' and override the start method to return 'Starting the SUV'. The Bicycle object should have no additional properties but should inherit the start method from the Vehicle prototype.
